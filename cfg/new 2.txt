go for aggressive peeks when they have the point (shorter respawn)
snipe looking at roof instead of ramp
kill flank or hardscope for people behind during the uber fight

if their sniper is hardscoped in and raping you, go for second scopes

always push up with the team on koth
don't be afraid to show the dot if they know where you are
