go for aggressive peeks when they have the point (shorter respawn)
snipe looking at roof instead of ramp
kill flank or hardscope for people behind during the uber fight

if their sniper is hardscoped in and raping you, go for second scopes

always push up with the team on koth
don't be afraid to show the dot if they know where you are
let only the players peeking you be able to see you

make your prescence known, that buys your team space
when the sniper is dead, try to hardscope more for the ez kills
don't be afraid to look behind for the flank when the sniper is dead
before you peek shutters, wait for the fullcharge
